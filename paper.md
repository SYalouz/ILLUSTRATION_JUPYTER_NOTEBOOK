# Summary

'QuantNBody' is a Python package providing numerical tools for quantum chemists/physicists interested in the development of methodologies to study quantum many-body problems ranging from electronic structure to condensed matter theory. It provides a quick and easy way to build matrix representations of quantum many-body operators (e.g. hamiltonians, spin operators) and get access to quantities/objects of interest (e.g. energies, reduced density matrices, many-body wave functions). The code provides various native tools and is flexible enough to help users in building new types of many-body operators or quantum states. 

# Statement of need
  
The numerical encoding of quantum many-body systems is crucial to get access to the exact properties 
of either ab initio or model systems in quantum chemistry and physics.
In practice, it requires developping a code that can build sparse matrix representations of quantum
operators (e.g. the Hamiltonian of a system) in a given quantum many-body basis.
Usually, this aspect is kept as ''blackbox'' in packages to spare the user from the cumbersome numerical parts.
In practice, this type of package implementation suits perfectly for the realization of applications. However, 
it turns out to be problematic for researchers in need of numerical tools to develop and test new methodologies and theories. 

The Python package 'QuantNBody' has been designed to help theoreticians who need an easy way to numerically create
and manipulate objects linked to quantum many-body systems. The package framework is based on the creation of a numerical
matrix representation of quantum operators in a given many-body basis with a special emphasis on the fermionic systems
(note that extensions are planned to include bosonic systems).  

The framework of the package lies in two fundamental ingredients. The first one is the creation of a reference
many-body basis (based on a total number of quantum particles and modes/orbitals to fill) in which every operator
can be represented. The second ingredient consists in creating a general tool that can help build any particle-number
conserving many-body operator : the single-body hopping operator $a^\dagger a$.  Once these two ingredients
have been created, the user can employ pre-built functions in order to (i) construct various type of many-body
operators (e.g. hamiltonians, spin operators), (ii) manipulate/visualize quantum many-body states. Note that
the QuantNBody package has been also designed to provide flexibility to the user so that the he/she can also create his/her
own operators and functions based on the tools already implemented in the code.

# A quick illustration

A few native many-body operators are already implemented in the QuantNBody package such as the ab initio
electronic structure Hamiltonian from quantum chemistry
\begin{equation} 
\hat{H} = \sum_{p,q} h_{pq} \sum_\sigma^{\uparrow,\downarrow} a^\dagger_{p,\sigma} a_{q,\sigma} 
+ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{p,q,r,s}  g_{pqrs} \sum_{\sigma,\tau}^{\uparrow,\downarrow} a^\dagger_{p,\sigma} a^\dagger_{r,\tau} a_{s,\tau} a_{q,\sigma}  
\end{equation}

or the Fermi-hubbard Hamiltonian from condensed matter theory
\begin{equation} 
\hat{H} = -t  \sum_{i,j} \sum_\sigma^{\uparrow,\downarrow} a^\dagger_{i,\sigma} a_{j,\sigma} 
+ U \sum_{i}  a^\dagger_{i,\uparrow}a_{i,\uparrow} a^\dagger_{i,\downarrow} a_{i,\downarrow}
\end{equation}

where $a^\dagger_{i,\sigma}$ ($a_{i,\sigma}$) are the fermionic creation (annihilation) operators for orbital $i$ with spin $\sigma$.

The QuantNBody package manages on its own the building of all the one- and two-body fermionic operators via the already built object $a^\dagger a$ mentioned earlier. The one-/two-body integrals (i.e.  $h_{pq}$, $g_{pqrs}$  and $t$ and $U$ ) however have to be defined by the user. They can be pure parameters of obtained from external chemistry python packages like PySCF [@sun2020recent] or Psi4 [@turney2012psi4]. As an illustration, we show in Fig. 1 a few results one can produce with the package for both hamiltonians.

The QuantNBody package is currently being used in several scientific projects realised in the "Laboratoire de Chimie Quantique de Strasbourg".
These projects are dedicated to the development of new methodologies to study strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and
condensed matter.
